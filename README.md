In this project we will be building an ETL data pipeline using Apache Airflow to pull Amazon Data Engineering Books. This pipeline will extract data engineering books from amazon, and stores it in Postgres Database. The pipeline runs on a schedule and pulls data from the website.

Key tools and languages that we will putting into use to build this project:

Python
Apache Airflow
Docker
PostgreSQL
Building a Data Engineering Pipeline usually consists of three steps:

Extract
Transform
Load
Commonly called “ETL Pipeline”.
